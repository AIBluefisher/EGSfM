Version 1.6.11
	* bug fixes

Version 1.6.10
	* fixed a radiusSearch bug introduced in 1.6.9

Version 1.6.9
	* bug fixes
	* fixed radius search bug on MSVC compiler
	* fixed windows linking problems

Version 1.6.8
	* bug fixes, low dimensional search speedup

Version 1.6.7
	* bug fixes

Version 1.6.6
	* misc bug fixes

Version 1.6.5
	* fix compilation problem on some C++ compilers

Version 1.6.4
	* small bug fix

Version 1.6.3
	* radius search speedup

Version 1.6.2
	* slight API changes to the C++ bindings, now the main index type is templated
	* on the distance functor which makes it easier to use custom distances
	* new kd-tree implementation optimized for low dimensionality data
	* experimental MPI support for cluster computing

Version 1.5
	* new C++ templated API
	* saving/loading of indices to disk
	* threadsafe search
	* new distance types (thanks to Radu Bogdan Rusu and Romain Thibaux for the patch)
	* (api change) autotuned is no longer selected by passing a precision >0, it's used when the algorithm type is set to autotuned
